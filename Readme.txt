Datasets. We collected 135 ZIKV genomes that coded for the full polyproteins from the National Center for Biotechnology Information up to February 28th, 2017. Five DENV genomes were included as reference sequences that are closely related to ZIKV. Annotations of protein families were generated using the Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) at www.viprbrc.org. The maximum length of the viral polyprotein was determined by the sum of the maximum lengths of the individual protein components in the datasets. Using the unweighted consensus, the minInDel positions were searched by Clustal, and the minInDel maps were produced with Geneious version 10.2.3. The alignment is evaluated by the BLOSUM 62 algorithm to mitigate any query with low similarity (<62% conserved amino acid residues) in a protein homology group across species.
